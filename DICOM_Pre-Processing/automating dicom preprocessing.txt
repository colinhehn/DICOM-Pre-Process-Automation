iterate through the file structure, regardless of how many we give the program (120076, 130002, 130003 directories)

1. Create variables for Database Info
	- DATABASE = mifar06
	- USERNAME = postgres
	- HOSTNAME = db.iclic.uihc.uiowa.edu
	- PASSWORD = ''
	- Designate which directory in the Database we want to conduct the script inside.

2. Script needs to connect to database first, in order to reach directory
	- Google "python connect to postgres database," from there find directory

3. Needs to iterate through certain directories
	- OUTERMOST LOOP: Going from patient to patient (120076 to 130002 to 130003)

	- For each of those patient directories:
		1. Find all necessary variables for changing
			- PatientName + StudyID given by overarching Directory name (120076)
			- Withdraw Slice Depth & Kernel from one of the DICOM files in the Directory (can be any)
			- Get PatientID by running SELECT mf_next_sub_autoname('H'), use what it returns

		2. dcmodify PatientName, PatientID, StudyID from the overarching Directory (-Recurse, this applies to every file)

		3. MAKE ANOTHER LOOP: Going from folder to folder (will just be 2, INSP and EXP folder)
			- For each folder:
				1. Find if it's INSP vs. EXP from directory name (.contains('FRC' or 'RV' or 'TLC')
				2. dcmodify SeriesDescription from each directory

		4. Boom all the stuff we needed to change has been changed: Pre-Processing Complete.


SIMPLIFIED FUNCTIONALITY
1. Connect to database
2. Iterate through each patient folder (120076, etc.)
3. Upon entering folder:
	- Acquire PatientName from folder, make StudyID
	- Acquire Slice Depth & Kernel, from first DICOM file you find.
	- Run SELECT mf_next_sub_autoname('H') for PatientID
	- dcmodify those variables (-Recurse) for all DICOM files in there.
4. Find INSP/EXP from folder name of each subdirectory
5.
