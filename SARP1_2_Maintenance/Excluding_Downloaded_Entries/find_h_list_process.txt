Need to use the files in SARP1_2 to see which H-Numbers we already have downloaded, and exclude those from being downloaded in the next query we make.
With the script Patrick gave me, I have a full list of all the H-Numbers we can grab, so subtract our current H-Numbers downloaded from that list.

Tasks (basic level):
    1. Compile list of H-Numbers from SARP1_2 directory.
    2. Cross reference that list with the one Patrick gave me. Subtract all H-Number's from list #1 from list #2 (one with all H-Numbers).
